    <h1> first blog ever! </h1>
    <p> im actually nervous idk why</p>
    <p> making stuff is scary. its never been easy for me really. i always feel like im behind or something and i can never <strong> catch up. </strong> </p>
    <p> im happy im working on stuff <i>(im a workaholic and love working ironically enough, despite me being constantly lazy)</i> but i get burnt out for like a day then immediately want to work again. its a awful cycle is what i think, but i never know what to think </p>
    <p> i love creating stuff. like alot </p>
    <p> thats the end of the first blog. ill make more soon haha </p>
